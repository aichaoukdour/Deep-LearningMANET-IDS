# Deep-LearningMANET-IDS
This project aims to develop an Anomaly-based Intrusion Detection System using Deep Learning to enhance the security of Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs). It focuses on detecting threats like DoS, Blackhole, Wormhole, and Sybil attacks, offering a dynamic and adaptive solution for securing decentralized networks.
